# Apply a manifest

Now we'll set some config on the Cisco IOS device using a Puppet manifest. In this example, we'll create a new NTP server on the switch.

1. Create a manifest file called `manifest.pp` with the following data - replace the IP address to something sensible if desired!

```
ntp_server { '1.1.1.1':
  ensure           => 'present',
  key              => 94,
  prefer           => true,
}
```

2. Apply the manifest using the `bolt apply` command:

`bolt apply manifest.pp -n cisco_ios`

This command uses the manifest to add the NTP servers listed above. You should see output similar to:

```
> bolt bolt apply manifest.pp -n cisco_ios
Starting: install puppet and gather facts on 1.1.1.1
Finished: install puppet and gather facts with 0 failures in 3.22 sec
Starting: apply catalog on 1.1.1.1
Finished: apply catalog with 0 failures in 8.06 sec
Finished on 1.1.1.1:
  changed: 1, failed: 0, unchanged: 0 skipped: 0, noop: 0
Successful on 1 node: 1.1.1.1
Ran on 1 node
```

3. To check that this worked we'll use the cli_command task to get the NTP servers returned. Run the command `bolt task run cisco_ios::cli_command --nodes cisco_ios --params '{"command":"show running-config | include ntp server","raw":true}'` and you should see the newly added NTP server available.

You have just used Bolt and a module to add an NTP Server to your switch.

4. Lastly, if you want check what that manifest is going to do before running it full apply mode, you can the simulation mode `noop` - this highlights the idempotent capabilities of Puppet. To test with `noop`, update the previous manifest and set the ensure property of the address range as `absent` and run the following command: 

`bolt apply manifest.pp -n cisco_ios --noop --debug`. 

Check the output and notice that a corrective change was run in `noop` mode â€” this means that the NTP server would have been removed if you had run the command without `noop`. If you do want to remove the newly created address range, run the same command without `noop` mode: 

`bolt apply manifest.pp -n cisco_ios`

# Next steps

That's it! You have now performed network automation with Bolt and a network device module. 

There are many other network automation tasks you can perform with Bolt. Some ideas are below.

* If you have multiple devices that you can test against, add extra nodes to the `inventory.yaml` file and your commands and manifests can be executed against them all. This may help you to, for example, report on NTP server settings across a number of devices with one command. Or you could run troubleshooting tasks across multiple devices in parallel. And you could try out bolt plans to chain together multiple commands against multiple devices. We'll add to this tutorial with additional content as time permits.
* Run Bolt on a jumphost to access devices on different network segments to your localhost using the [run-on](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_configuration_options.html#remote-transport-configuration-options) option.
* Use [bolt plans](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/writing_plans.html) for more complex automation.
* Learn more about tasks and Bolt using the [Bolt hands-on-lab](https://github.com/puppetlabs/tasks-hands-on-lab).
* Check out the [Palo Alto](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/panos/reference) module on the Forge to see what else you can automate with Puppet and Bolt.
